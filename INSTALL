nwreckdum -- PACK file manipulator for the Linux console
by Daniel Reed <n@ml.org>
based on wreckdum by Neal Tucker <ntucker@fester.axis.net>

To compile nwreckdum, first look through the included Makefile and make
any changed you see fit. The default CFLAGS are optimized for a 486 or
higher Intel machine. If this does not match your configuration, try
removing the "-m486" from the CFLAGS. After the Makefile is configured to
your liking, just run "make" at the console prompt. This will produce a
binary named "nwreckdum."

To install, simply cp the nwreckdum binary to /usr/local/bin. No data
files are used (except for your PACK files!), so the binary is all that's
necessary.
