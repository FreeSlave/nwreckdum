nwreckdum -- PACK file manipulator for the Linux console
by Daniel Reed <n@ml.org>
based on wreckdum by Neal Tucker <ntucker@fester.axis.net>

Usage: nwreckdum [argument ...]

  -c, --create          create PACK instead of extracting
  -d, --dir=DIR use DIR as the input/output directory
  -h, --help            display this help
  -p, --pak=FILE        read FILE for PACK information
  
Just running nwreckdum with no arguments will cause it to use "pak0.pak"
for the PACK file and "pak0/" for the PACK directory. The default
operation is to extract the PACK file into the PACK directory.
